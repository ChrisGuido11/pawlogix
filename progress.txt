## IN PROGRESS:

## NEXT:

## KNOWN BUGS:
(none yet — needs testing)

## NOTES:
- This is a FREE BETA. No paywalls or payment logic.
- Killer feature: AI Record Interpreter (scan vet records → plain English interpretation)
- All tables use pl_ prefix (multi-tenant Supabase project)
- .env needs real SUPABASE_ANON_KEY before running
- Edge Functions need ANTHROPIC_API_KEY secret before deploying
